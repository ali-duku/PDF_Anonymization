# Anonymizer

Anonymizer is a browser-based, PDF-first tool for OCR overlay review and anonymization edits.

## Release Discipline

Every functional/UI update must include both:

- A new top entry in `src/appMeta.ts` under `releaseNotes`.
- Documentation updates (`README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/MAINTENANCE.md`) when behavior, structure, or process changes.

## Latest Update

- **v0.6.5 (2026-03-24)**
  - Replaced fixed entity `<select>` inputs with a searchable entity dropdown field in both anonymization entity pickers.
  - Updated anonymize flow so pressing `Anonymize` opens entity input in an empty state until a valid catalog label is selected.
  - Added stricter entity apply validation so unknown/free-typed labels are rejected with clear warning feedback.

## Core Features

- Dark-mode interface with compact app shell.
- Main `Viewer` tab for PDF rendering, overlay interaction, and region editing.
- `Setup` tab for JSON input, generation, copy, and loading overlays into Viewer.
- Viewer supports:
  - Secure retrieval by ID through simulated backend contract (`api/getfile?id=<id>`).
  - Page navigation, zoom, and fit-width.
  - Overlay drag/resize/create.
  - Region dialog editing (label/text/entities), span anonymization, and delete.
  - Searchable entity-label dropdown for both new anonymization spans and span-editor updates.
  - Draggable outer dialog pane separator with session-scoped width persistence.
  - Current-page bbox Previous/Next navigation while editing.
  - Region snippet zoom controls with right-click/drag-save prevention.
- Setup supports:
  - Uncontrolled input/output textareas for large JSON payloads.
  - Pretty-printed generation output.
  - Copy-to-clipboard.
  - Load-to-Viewer with confirmation guards.
- App-level Save / Undo / Redo with keyboard shortcuts.
